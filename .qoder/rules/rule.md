When improving UI/UX design in this project, you must strictly follow these rules:

Do Not Break Functionality

Never remove or alter existing functions, state management, or API calls.

All buttons, inputs, navigation, and forms must remain fully functional.

Preserve all IDs, props, hooks, and event handlers.

Modern UI Design Principles

Use a clean, minimal, and consistent visual style.

Prioritize whitespace, proper padding, and alignment.

Apply a clear hierarchy of typography (headline, subheadline, body).

Use rounded corners, smooth shadows, and subtle transitions.

Prefer a neutral/light or dark theme with one primary accent color for actions.

Accessibility & Usability

Ensure all text has sufficient color contrast.

Buttons must look clickable and have hover/active states.

Inputs should be clearly labeled and user-friendly.

Add responsive design (mobile-first) where possible.

Consistency

Keep consistent spacing, button styles, card layouts, and typography across screens.

Reuse components instead of creating multiple variations of the same element.

Interaction & Feedback

Add hover effects, loading indicators, and success/error states.

Ensure navigation is intuitive with clear back/forward flows.

Donâ€™t Overcomplicate

No unnecessary animations or complex layouts.

Stick to clarity and simplicity over decoration.

Check Before Finalizing

Always confirm that all features, routes, and functions still work.

If you are unsure about a change breaking something, leave a comment instead of modifying it.
